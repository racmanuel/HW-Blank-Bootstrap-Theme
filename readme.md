Based on
https://github.com/sebastienb/Bootstrap-3-blank-wordpress-theme

I created this theme from the Bootstrap tarter Wordpress theme by 3sparks, as a starting point for my theme development, feel free to use it for your new projects. 

###Instructions
* Clone the Bootrstap Sass version inside the src/ directory
* Update the path to the _bootstrap.scss file in css/bootstrap.scss
* Run `gulp` to start watching your files. Use the livereload browser extension to have your browser automatically refreshed.
* To use the bootstrap variables you can edit the original _variables.scss or use any of them directly in your css/bootstrap.scss file, just before the @import. This way you can keep your variables if you update your bootstrap version
* To optimize your final Bootstrap css comment in _bootstrap.css all the components you're not using
